        <h2>What is Contribute.md</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><em>All help is welcome</strong></em><br />
          For many beginners the world of open source is complicated and scary. However making new features isnâ€™t the only way you can 
          contribute to an open source project. Contribute.md makes it easier to find ways to help     
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><em>Simple and straightforward</strong></em><br/> 
          Contribute.md is a way to give everyone the tools to help in their favorite open source project, whether they are technical or not. 
          It makes contributing friendly, simple and straightforward by providing a template maintainers can fill to help new community members 
          to contribute. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Open source is for everyone</strong></em><br/>
          Open source is important. However, maintaining a project can be time consuming and all types of help are welcome.
          Including people with different skillsets to your project will make it even more awesome.
